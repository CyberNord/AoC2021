# AoC2021

Advent of Code 2021
All the code posted online was created by me. Use is permitted, however you have to make a shoutout to the source (me).

Extensions.kt contains code from a good friend. Since the person does not want his src to be made public, this file is not shared.
The missing functionalities have to be worked out by yourself.
