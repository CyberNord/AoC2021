# AoC2021

Advent of Code 2021

Beginner in Kotlin, so the code may be heavily commented and/or additional debuging-prints.

Extensions.kt contains code from a good friend. Since the person does not want his src to be made public, this file is not shared.
The missing functionalities have to be worked out by yourself.
